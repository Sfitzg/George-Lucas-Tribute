                                George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is
                                an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. Lucas is
                                known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana
                                Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm,
                                LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He
                                served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling
                                it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After graduating from the University of Southern
                                California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American
                                Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola.
                                Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based
                                on his earlier student short Electronic
                                Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical
                                success but a financial failure. His next work
                                as a writer-director was the film American
                                Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early
                                1960s Modesto, California, and produced through
                                the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was
                                critically and commercially successful, and
                                received five Academy Award nominations
                                including Best Picture.

                                Lucas's next film, the epic space opera Star
                                Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a
                                surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film
                                at the time, winning six Academy Awards and
                                sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced
                                and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back
                                (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With
                                director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced
                                and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of
                                the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The
                                Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal
                                Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a
                                variety of films and television series through
                                Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.

                                In 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy
                                as part of a special edition featuring several
                                alterations; home media versions with further
                                changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He
                                returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel
                                trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999),
                                Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the
                                Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the
                                CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The
                                Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red
                                Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic

                                Lucas is one of history's most financially
                                successful filmmakers and has been nominated for
                                four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100
                                highest-grossing movies at the North American
                                box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation.
                                Lucas is considered a significant figure of the
                                20th-century New Hollywood movement.
